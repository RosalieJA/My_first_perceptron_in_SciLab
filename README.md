**Description**:
MyFirstPerceptron is a set of annotated scilab codes designed to implement simple artificial neural networks using sigmoid functions. These codes are based on my 2nd year dissertation in Applied Maths (MT94 course, @UTC) and were benchmarked on synthetically-generated data.
MyFirstPerceptron scripts were tested on SciLab versions 6.1, 2023 and 2024.

**More resources** (e.g., mathematical expressions) can be found in my dissertation (RJ_MT94_Cahier_d_int√©gration_P23.pdf, written in French).

**Expected future additions**: multi-layer perceptron, implementation of the ReLU function, training/testing on real data, performance plots.
